## Ghosts
There are 4 Ghosts: Barry, Garry, Larry, Scott

_Barry_: Roams around the level, chases the player when found, runs away when pills are consumed

_Garry_: Roams around the Power Pills in the level, chases the player when found, runs away when pills are consumed

_Larry_: Roams around the level, chases the player when found, runs away when pills are consumed (did have plans to make Larry invisble and roam between the Power Pills, similarly to Garry, but couldn't figure out the logic in time)

_Scott_: Roams around the level, chases the player when found, runs away when pills are consumed

## Additional Details
This project also utilises Nav Modifiers (NavArea's) and NavigationQueryFilter's. These have an affect on the AI's movement. They allow to add aditional costs to the AI's pathfinding (making the movement slightly different than the regular A* pathfinding).




This project requires Unreal Engine version 4.22.3.

This project uses the ["Ghost" 3D model by Luca Perencin](https://poly.google.com/view/6tcLAzFt-A2), licensed under CC-BY.
